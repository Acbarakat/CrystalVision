    "## Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "Card games have been around since the 9th century AD; a boon from the new technology of woodblock printing [(Wilkinson, 1895)](https://zenodo.org/record/1448960). These games have made it across centuries and across continents giving use the recognizable French-suited 52-card deck - cards that have relatively simple anatomy; each one has a rank, a suit, and is the relatively the same if flipped 180-degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduced in 1993 with *Magic: The Gathering*, trading card games are great advancement on card games and a great learning tools for learning building, strategy, and dynamic responses [(Turkay et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.sbspro.2012.06.130). Today, the anatomy of cards in games like the *Final Fantasy Trading Card Game* are complex yet easily human recognizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "As outlined in David Forsyth and Jean Ponce's *Computer Vision: A Modern Approach*, recognition is one of Computer Vision's typical tasks. This act of recognition can come in the differing varieties of object classification, identification, and detection. For this project, I will be tackling recognition as best as possible. Beginning with classification step, I will make different models using the same inputs mapping to different outputs based on the card's anatomy, such as, *element*, *type*, *power*, *artist*, etc. I will also research on multi-class classification and see what techniques (if such exist publically) could be utilized. I hypothesize that the identity of a card can be derived by taking all these elements and traversing a graph-database. The larger stretch goal of being able to perform object detection via video (webcam) feed would enable the ultimate real-world application of playing games across languages or displaying the current prices for the purpose of trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting potential, if integrated with AR, could provided more experiental novelties by overlaying clips from the game or a AR-avatar over the card. The full-scale recognition, through the use of a CNN (likely ResNet model), could help with an in medias res AI analysis of potential strategies to aid a play to make the best plays. The environment being so stochastic, at least in comparison to a chess board, makes such applications, even in terms of model-representations interesting."

    "## Inspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By taking the standard deck as the basis, this person has used non-ML detection to identify the cards. By using a simple/stable background and applying gaussian blur on a grayscale image, they then find contours after some thresholding. After finding such contours, the image is then warped to the standard facing card and a manual comparison between stored images of the rank/suit for the deck is then compared to determine what card it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very manual effort that is only feasible for a specific deck-printing and the limited nature of the deck. In TCGs, hundreds of new cards get released every few months.\n",

    "This person has attempted detection in similar way but applying it a small to *Magic: the Gathering* cards (per set). In essence by greatly reducing the pool of possible cards, polling the top amount of pixels that would the cards *name*, and applying OCR the card can be identified. This approach heavily relies on the legibility (high enough DPI/megapixels) and can be prone to error depending on the OCR technique and/or library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, a very manual effort that cannot differentiate between languages or different art styles or printing processes -- all of which directly affect a card's value.\n",

    "## Card Anatomy\n",
    "\n",
    "The anatomy of a card are the identifiable features. With good graphic design, the major features are the most visually prominent. *Final Fantasy Trading Card Game* (FFTCG) has over 2600 unique cards and at least 11 features - where I would consider, at minimum, 5 to be major features: *name*, *element*, *type*, *cost*, *power*. These would be the primary things I would train, as the more minor features such *illustrator* would be useful to break identification ties."

Second to that, there are some cards that can be more than one element at the same time, for this project, I will consider not adding these to the dataset for simplicity.\n",
