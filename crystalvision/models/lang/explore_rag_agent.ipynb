For example, if damage is taken when there are two cards in the Damage Zone and zero cards in the player's deck, the “Damage -- 3” effect will not activate.\\n\\n- You will not lose the game from [7-130L] Sin's “Giga Graviton” effect “your opponent loses the game” being resolved. This still applies, even if Garnet subsequently leaves the field.\\n\\n- If both players are in control of Garnet and have taken seven or more points of damage, and both Garnets leave the field simultaneously then the game will end in a no score draw.\\n\\n[Rules relating to official tournaments]\\n\\nIt is not possible to prevent defeat from any causes outside of those governed within the game rules (general rules) or by card effects, such as declaration of a draw or loss through judges decisions based on damage differential etc. due to match time running out. It is also still possible to concede a match while controlling Garnet.\\n\\nFor matches where a clear winner and a loser need to be found, such as in knock-out tournaments, if a situation occurs where both players control Garnet and the regular game time and extended time have already elapsed, with judges ruling that no difference in the respective amounts of damage inflicted will occur even if play continues, that game is declared a draw and the winner is decided using a random method such as tossing a coin or rolling a dice. (If the game declared a draw in this manner is the second game of a match using a first to two wins system, the player who won the first game will be declared the winner of the match.)\"),\n",
